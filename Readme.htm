	AddOns folder.&nbsp; You need Hear Kitty 1.2 or later installed to use sound 
	packs.</p>
<h2>Choosing new sounds</h2>
<p>To choose a new set of sounds for Hear Kitty, open the World of Warcraft game 
menu, then click Interface, and then the AddOns tab in the upper-left.&nbsp; 
Choose Hear Kitty from the list.&nbsp; Then, find the dropdown labeled "sound 
pack" and choose a new sound pack.&nbsp; When you click one, you'll hear a 
preview of its tones.</p>
<p>You can choose a different sound pack for each of your characters.</p>
