# Hear Kitty official sound packs

This package includes several different sound packs for use in Hear Kitty:

- Symphony
- Symphony (loud)
- Symphony (quiet)
- Crystal
- Crystal (quiet)
- Powerup

## Installing

Hear Kitty sound packs are installed like any other World of Warcraft addon. If you're not using a tool to manage your addons, extract the HearKitty_SoundPacks folder from the zip file to your addons folder, which will be in a location like one of these:

```
C:\Users\Public\Games\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns
C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns
C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns
```

## Choosing new sounds

To choose a new set of sounds for Hear Kitty, open the World of Warcraft game menu, then click Interface, and then the AddOns tab in the upper-left.  Choose Hear Kitty from the list.  Then, find the dropdown labeled "sound pack" and choose a new sound pack.  When you click one, you'll hear a preview of its tones.

You can choose a different sound pack for each of your characters.
